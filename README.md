# Hello, I'm Claes ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience,
working with FPGA and ASIC, embedded Linux, and DevOps. As an engineer I continously
try to improve and automate my work and everyday life.

### Dotfiles

One of my main repositories contains my carefully curated dotfiles, configured and optimized using Ansible for my Arch Linux environment. These dotfiles are tailored to my preferences for tiling window managers and Emacs, with a focus on simplicity, productivity, and personalization. Feel free to explore my [dotfiles repository][dotfiles-repo] to learn more.

### Smart Home Automation

I also maintain a repository for my smart home setup, where I leverage Ansible, Docker
Compose, and NixOS to manage and orchestrate various services. This allows me to
create an efficient and customizable smart home environment that aligns with my needs.
Feel free to explore my [smart-home repository][smart-home-repo] to get inspired for your own smart home projects.

## Other Interests

Apart from my programming endeavors, I have a passion for homemade pizza-making,
where I take pride in crafting the dough and creating delicious combinations of
flavors. In addition, I find fulfillment in challenging myself physically through
CrossFit workouts, pushing my limits and embracing a active lifestyle.
