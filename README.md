### Dotfiles

My main repository contains my curated dotfiles, configured and optimized with Ansible
for Arch Linux. These dotfiles are tailored for tiling window managers and Emacs,
focusing on simplicity, productivity, and personalization. Explore my [dotfiles repository][dotfiles-repo]
to learn more.

### Smart Home Automation

I maintain a repository for my smart home setup, using Ansible, Docker Compose, and
NixOS to manage and orchestrate services. This creates an efficient and customizable
smart home environment. Explore my [smart-home repository][smart-home-repo] for inspiration.

## Other Interests

I enjoy making homemade pizza, crafting the dough, and creating delicious flavor
combinations. I also challenge myself with CrossFit workouts.
